# The ModeShape project

ModeShape is an open source implementation of the JCR 2.0 ([JSR-283](http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=283])) specification and standard API.
To your applications, ModeShape looks and behaves like a regular JCR repository. Applications can search, query, navigate, change, version, listen for changes, etc.
But ModeShape can store that content in a variety of back-end stores (including relational databases, Infinispan data grids, JBoss Cache, etc.), or it can
access and update existing content from *other* kinds of systems (including file systems, SVN repositories, JDBC database metadata, and other JCR repositories).
ModeShape's connector architecture means that you can write custom connectors to access any kind of system. And ModeShape can even federate multiple back-end systems
into a single, unified virtual repository.

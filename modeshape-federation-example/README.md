# ModeShape Federation Example

This is a self-contained Maven project that shows how to configure ModeShape in order to expose external content.
[ModeShapeExample](modeshape-federation-example/src/main/java/org/modeshape/example/federation/ModeShapeExample.java)
class has a 'main(...)' method that loads a ModeShape configuration  as a resource on the classpath, uses that configuration to
build a  ModeShapeEngine instance, starts the engine, and obtains a JCR Session to the repository.

This project is self-contained and can be built at the top level of your 
local clone of the Git repository, or by simply building this project 
using Maven 3:

    $ mvn clean install

See [this ModeShape community article](http://community.jboss.org/wiki/ModeShapeandMaven) 
for help on how to install Maven 3.

# The ModeShape project

ModeShape is an open source implementation of the JCR 2.0 
([JSR-283](http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=283])) specification and 
standard API. To your applications, ModeShape looks and behaves like a 
regular JCR repository. Applications can search, query, navigate, change, 
version, listen for changes, etc. But ModeShape can store that content 
in a variety of back-end stores (including relational databases, Infinispan 
data grids, JBoss Cache, etc.), or it can access and update existing content 
from *other* kinds of systems (including file systems, SVN repositories, 
JDBC database metadata, and other JCR repositories). ModeShape's connector 
architecture means that you can write custom connectors to access any 
kind of system. And ModeShape can even federate multiple back-end systems 
into a single, unified virtual repository.

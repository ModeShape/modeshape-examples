# ModeShape Web application example

This is a simple self-contained Maven project that shows how to get access repository bound in JNDI either via native JCR API or using JNDI API

Before run this demo make sure that you have installed Modeshape repository and the repository is bound to some JNDI name. The simplest way to do it is use JBoss AS7 and install Modeshape following to intructions provided by the wiki page (https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/MODE/Installing+ModeShape+into+AS7) which explains how to start ModeShape engine as AS7 subsystem with two preconfigured sample repositories: sample and artifacts (see conf/standalone-modeshape.xml). Both repositories by default are bound to the JNDI under name jcr/sample and jcr/artifacts respectively so we don't need to do anything more with that configuration.

User is able to specify repository JNDI name and an absolute path to the node. Into the response this application will show childs of the node pointed by the specified path. The format of Repository location parameter defines which approach will be used to get the access to the repository. If Repository location looks like URI with 'jndi:' prefix (i.e. jndi:/jcr/artifacts) the native JCR API will be used and otherwise (i.e. jcr/artifacts) the Initial context will be used to lookup repository in JNDI 

This project is self-contained and can be built at the top level of your local clone of the Git repository,
or by simply building this project using Maven 3:

    $ mvn clean install

See [this ModeShape community article](http://community.jboss.org/wiki/ModeShapeandMaven) for help on how to install Maven 3.

# The ModeShape project

ModeShape is an open source implementation of the JCR 2.0 ([JSR-283](http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=283])) specification and standard API.
To your applications, ModeShape looks and behaves like a regular JCR repository. Applications can search, query, navigate, change, version, listen for changes, etc.
But ModeShape can store that content in a variety of back-end stores (including relational databases, Infinispan data grids, JBoss Cache, etc.), or it can
access and update existing content from *other* kinds of systems (including file systems, SVN repositories, JDBC database metadata, and other JCR repositories).
ModeShape's connector architecture means that you can write custom connectors to access any kind of system. And ModeShape can even federate multiple back-end systems
into a single, unified virtual repository.
